Figured out how to use docker compose today and how to share volumes

- try committing files within the container, pulling them locally. Pushing locally, pulling in container
- Figure out how to enter bash shell in container using docker-compose. The CL command is really long otherwise -- probably using "docker-compose run"

*-----

with docker-compose.yml, can run interactive shell using
$ sudo docker-compose run {service_name} {shell}
$ sudo docker-compose run project /bin/bash

Now to make sure jupyter is accessible...
$ sudo docker-compose run --service-port project /bin/bash
or expose ports directly 
$ sudo docker-compose run -p 8888:8888 project /bin/bash

You must source a .bashrc within the container for it to work - doesn't happen if in dockerfile only

OUTCOMES
I was having hard time echo-ing to a .bashrc file that was in /home/ because
/home/ was also a volume linked to my local machine. Apparently all the Dockerfile
commands happen (creating my .bashrc), then the volume is linked, erasing any new
files I put in /home/(unlinked), which becomes /home/(linked)

Set up pydoit, template dodo.py file and environment. Found the location of all the data for download

Figured out how to convert lat/lon coordinates into 3D cartesian ones using pyproj. Wrote the baseline code for it in code/organize_data.py Still need to update it and put it in a way that's easy for pydoit to run the stuff :)

TODO: 
  - convert all lat/lon to (x,y,z) cartesian coordinates linked to NCESSCH id
  - Create kd-tree of x,y,z points, then search it by designated distance.
      - Might be able to do this on the fly, might have to pre-compute some values, do it on the fly first.
  - Figure out the segregation of given schools using stat-test, and the student population breakdown from the kd-tree
